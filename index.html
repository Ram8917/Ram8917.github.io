            <p><strong>Topic: Starting Up</strong></p>
            <p>I have decided to create this digital garden. As I study complex systems and fluid dynamics, I realize that explaining concepts to others is the best way to verify my own understanding. This space will serve as my public notebook. It will have focused writeups and daily entries about things which intrigue me.</p>

            <p><strong>Topic: The photo got clicked! </strong></p>
            <p>So today I was dealing with the same feeling of not wanting to pick up my course material or anything that requires some activation energy. I got fed up and decided that this is where things would change and hence came up with an idea to completely change my digital environment and ways to train my brain into the direction I want to. Along with that I came up with this idea of creating a vision board for the next 1 year and for distant future. I used gemini to do so. I gave it my picture and defined clearly the kind of pictures I want in my vision board and it came up with a picture of me getting the Best MS thesis award from the director and me delivering a very nice talk on my MS thesis work. I felt "Ye to ho gaya"|"It is done" as in these thigns which I wanted to do are done. I can see myself get these and hence the picture I would have asked papa mummy to click has already been taken and it looks perfect.  So, now what ? Hmmmmmm this made me think about why exactly do I want to have those situations in my life. To get a good photo which I can upload on the social media or to experience the happiness that comes after working very hard continuously ? So my friend, the picture has been clicked, now do it for the sake of the task.  </p>
